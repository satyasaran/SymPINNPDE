# Physics-Informed Neural Network with Symbolic Regression for Deriving Analytical Approximate Solutions to Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations

This work explores an interpretable approach based on **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** combined with **Symbolic Regression (SR)** to derive mathematical expressions for approximate solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) modeling arterial blood flow influenced by external magnetic fields.

While PINNs are adept at learning physics-informed representations, they often lack interpretability and require significant computational resources. To address this, we integrate the **PySR symbolic regression framework** with PINNs. PySR utilizes **evolutionary genetic programming** with a customizable set of mathematical operators (trigonometric, exponential, arithmetic, etc.) to extract concise symbolic expressions from PINN-generated data.

### Highlights:
- PINNs capture physical laws from PDEs representing pulsatile blood flow under magnetic influence.
- Symbolic regression provides transparent, analytical approximations of these solutions.
- The resulting expressions are:
  - Accurate (low MSE)
  - Statistically validated
  - Real-time executable
- Numerical and statistical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the hybrid approach.
- This methodology offers interpretable insights into biofluid mechanics, especially the interaction between magnetic fields and viscoelastic blood flow.
